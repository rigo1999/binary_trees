# Binary Tree Learning Project

Welcome to the Binary Tree Learning Project repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of binary trees and their various properties and operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain, without relying on external resources, the following concepts related to binary trees:

- Understanding of what a binary tree is and its basic properties.
- Differentiating between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Analyzing the time complexity advantages of binary trees over linked lists.
- Understanding concepts such as depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Familiarity with different traversal methods used to navigate through a binary tree.
- Recognition of different types of binary trees, including complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

### General

- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- **File Structure**: Each file should end with a new line. A README.md file at the root is mandatory.
- **Coding Style**: Your code should adhere to the Betty style guidelines.
- **Functions**: No more than 5 functions per file.
- **Global Variables**: Not allowed.
- **Standard Library**: You are permitted to use the standard library.
- **Header Files**: Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `binary_trees.h`, which must be included guarded.
- **Testing**: You can use provided `main.c` files to test your functions.
